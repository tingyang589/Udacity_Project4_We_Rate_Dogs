# Udacity_Project_We_Rate_Dogs

This Project is part of the Udacity Nanodegree course.

## Project Overview

In this project, I will be using Python and its libraries to gather data from different sources, access its quality and tidiess, then clean the data before analysis.
The dataset that I will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs.

The goal of this project is to wrangle data from WeRateDogs Twitter's account using Python and document the whole process in a Jupyter Notebook named wrangle_act.ipynb i.e. this notebook. My aim is to wrangle this data for interesting and trustworthy analyses using visualizations.
